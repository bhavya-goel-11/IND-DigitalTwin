# IND-DigitalTwin Hackathon Pitch

## Title
Accelerated Indian Urban Junction Digital Twin Toolkit

## One-Liner
Cut scenario authoring time for complex Indian junctions from hours to minutes with a config + augmentation pipeline that injects local road realism (potholes, barricades, informal lane usage, multi-class traffic) directly into MATLAB Automated Driving simulations.

## Problem
Current traffic modeling workflows assume clean geometry and disciplined behavior, failing to represent Indian on-road complexity (micro-obstacles, mixed vehicle swarms, informal negotiation). Manual reconstruction of these patterns delays experimentation.

## Solution
A modular, reproducible pipeline:
1. Configurable geometry source (canonical template or OSM)
2. Indian micro-feature asset library (potholes, barricade clusters, parked rickshaws)
3. Heuristic geometry-aware placement
4. Multi-class stochastic traffic spawning with behavior profiles
5. Variation generation for rapid what-if exploration
6. Metrics and report export (counts, composition, features)

## Innovation
- Treats micro-features as first-class configurable assets
- Separation of scenario intent (JSON) from MATLAB generation code
- Variation & reproducibility baked in via seeds
- Extensible: future natural-language spec → JSON → scenario

## Technical Depth
- Geometry inference and directional approach classification
- Poisson arrival multi-class traffic generation
- Behavior profile attachment enabling downstream model calibration
- Modular augmentation ready for plug-in rules (speed modifiers, closures)

## Feasibility
Already functioning scaffold generating scenarios with:
- Micro-feature placement (heuristic)
- Multi-class actors
- Variation set generation
- Metrics introspection

## Scalability
- Add new assets by dropping JSON definitions
- Integrates with larger simulation toolchains (Simulink / control layers) without rewrite
- Future: parallel variant generation

## Impact
Enables faster prototyping for congestion management, infrastructure planning, and crisis simulation by accelerating high-fidelity scenario preparation.

## Demo Narrative (2–3 minutes)
1. Show config JSON (intent-level specification)
2. Run generation script → scenario created
3. Display feature placements & counts
4. Show multi-class vehicle summary
5. Generate 3 variations; show differences in counts
6. (Optional) Explain how adding a new feature requires only metadata + placement rule

## Ask
Adopt toolkit internally for pilot evaluations and extend with official OSM import + parameterized driver models.

## Future Roadmap
| Phase | Feature | Value |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 3 | OSM full parsing | Real-world geometry fidelity |
| 3 | Speed & headway modifiers | Realistic congestion dynamics |
| 4 | NL-to-config parser | Non-technical scenario authoring |
| 4 | Visual report export | Stakeholder communication |
| 5 | Parallel batch & KPIs | Policy simulation scaling |

## Team Roles (Example)
- Scenario Architect: config schema & templates
- Behavior Engineer: driver model parameterization
- Data Integrator: OSM parsing
- UI/AI Engineer: NL assist pipeline
